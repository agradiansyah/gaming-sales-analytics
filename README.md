## GameZone Insights: From Raw Data to Sales Dashboard

## Project Overview
FunZone is a gaming store selling gaming products via store, web and mobile app.
Analyzed 20K+ messy sales records to track trends by product, region, and channel.
Cleaned and processed data in Excel, then built interactive dashboards in Tableau Public.

## What I did and Why

1. Cleaned and standardized data by removing duplicates and null values, ensuring accuracy and consistency for analysis.
2. Fixed illogical data issues, such as cases where the shipping date appeared before the order date, to improve data integrity and reliability.
3. Standardized naming conventions and corrected errors to create a unified dataset that is easy to understand and work with.
4. Designed and built interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize sales performance, uncover insights, and support data-driven decision-making.

Tracked and documented data quality problems found during cleaning.
This ensured accurate analysis and reliable insights.
